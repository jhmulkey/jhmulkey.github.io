        <h1>Setup Guide</h1>
        <h2>OFF BOARDS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Put all silverlings and worker tiles in piles.</li>
                <li>Put all hex tiles in random, face-down piles by back color.</li>
                <li>Give each player two dice of same color.</li>
                <li>Give each player one victory point tile (match dice color).</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>GAME BOARD</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Put 5 random, face-down piles of 5 goods tiles each in phase spaces A-E and then move the 5 goods tiles in phase space A face-up into the 5 round spaces.</li>
                <li>Place all bonus tiles on bonus tile spaces by size and color.</li>
                <li>Put playing piece for each player (match dice color) on point space zero (0).</li>
                <li>Randomly place hex tiles face-up in each depot slot (including black depot) of the same color as the tile, except for slots with a number higher than the number of players (note that hex tiles with a black dot on front and black back are only to be placed in the black depot).</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>PLAYER BOARDS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Place 1 castle on estate.</li>
                <li>Place 3 random goods tiles (not from phase spaces) in the goods spaces (grouped by color).</li>
                <li>Place 1 silverling in silverling storage space.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>START OF GAME</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Determine start player by dice roll. Starting player gets 1 worker, second player gets 2 workers, etc.</li>
                <li>Place playing pieces on turn order track ordered from top to bottom (starting player on top).</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>END OF EACH PHASE</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove all hex tiles (including black depot) from game board, and do not reuse them for the rest of the game. Replace them randomly from the unused tiles.</li>
                <li>Move the 5 goods tiles in the next phase space face-up into the 5 round spaces (do not remove any remaining goods from the depots).</li>
                <li>Give each player 1 silverling for each mine on their estate.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>IMPORTANT REMINDERS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For a 3-player game in phases B and D, put a mine instead of a castle on space 3 of depot 6.</li>
                <li>The starting player determines which depot the current round space goods tile goes to by rolling the white dice at the start of the round (this dice roll cannot be adjusted with workers).</li>
                <li>The only way to obtain goods is by placing a ship on your estate, and you take all the goods from any one depot (or from two neighboring depots if knowledge tile #5 is on estate).</li>
                <li>When selling goods, you must sell all goods of one type (color) at once.</li>
                <li>When moving up on the turn-order track (after placing ship on estate), your playing piece goes on top of any other playing pieces that are in the next space on the track.</li>
                <li>The initial starting player is determined by the highest roll of the white dice, and player order proceeds clockwise from this starting player (playing pieces on turn order track are placed with starting player on top and last player on bottom).  However, once players move up on the turn order track, playing order is always determined by the position of pieces on the turn order track, from right to left and top to bottom.</li>
                <li>All actions allowed by the placement of a hex tile must be taken immediately before any other actions are taken.  For example, if a player places a city hall, he cannot first buy another hex tile from the black depot in order to place it using the city hall's action.</li>
            </ul>
